Bug Log

What:    Cannot receive interrupt
How:    i8259â€™s mask turns out its active low, bitwise not fixed it.

What:    Higher number of irq handler executed on wrong number
How:    No alignment for the idt jump table. Adding many .align

What:    Can only receive first irq
How:    forget to send eoi on slave pin on master pic

What:    KB and RTC can only receive first irq
How:    Both need to inb to act as a ack

What:    Backspace doesn't work
How:    need to add a lot of function and if else if to take care of all edge cases

What:    What is a dir read
How:    Oh so it returns all file names

What:    After execute it runs the program but kb read fails instantly
How:    We have to init stdin and stdout at execute

What:    Shell runs and execute another program works fine but cannot halt correctly, page fault
How:    We need to modify TSS so kernel page are perfectly separated

What:    Cannot run more than 8 times a single program, returns no such command
How:    Halt need to clean the PCB for next use

What:    After some runs file cannot be opened
How:    Halt need to also clean FD

What:    Switch Terminal mostly done but nothing appears on the screen when printf
How:    If PageDirEntry have size = 1 then it doesn't looks for its PageTable apparently

What:    Running rtc and pit together result in stackoverflow
How:    tss.esp0 will always to be pointed to the bottom of the kernel page, no need to calculate each time

What:    Sometimes execute program doesn't work
How:    Turns out the return value in kb_read is 1 larger than the size result in ghost value

What:    Calculated rtc frequency makes fish moving too slow
How:    qemu have some weird rtc so the frequency needs to be multiplied by 8 to have actual speed.
